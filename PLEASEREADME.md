# Advantics

Hello,
I tried my best to complete the given tasks as efficiently as possible while trying to keep the code easy to read.
I have to say working with you at Advantics in this position would truly be a dream come true for me and definitely would make me push my limits to the maximum.
Taking part in these challenges was a blast and regardless of the outcome of this particular test, I deeply believe that I am a good fit for the company, my ability to learn quick and my drive make me want to improve myself on a daily basis as a person and as an engineer
Electronics and robotics have always been a passion of mine and combining them with software engineering has always been my dream.Therefore working at Advantics as a software engineer is really what I want and I believe within a short period of time I would be a valuable member of your team, if you give me this chance.

Greetings,
